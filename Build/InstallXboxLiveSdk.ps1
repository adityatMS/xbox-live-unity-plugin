.SYNOPSIS
  Install the Xbox Live SDK into the Unity project
.PARAMETER FromSource
  Build the SDK from the xbox-live-api-csharp submodule and copy the binaries.
.PARAMETER FromNuget
  Download the SDK NuGet package and copy the binaries from there.
.PARAMETER CopyOnly,
  If FromSource is provided then the built binaries will just be copied as opposed
  to performing a rebuild and copying after.
